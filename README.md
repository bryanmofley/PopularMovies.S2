This is a Stage 2 project from Udacity's [Android Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/android-developer-nanodegree-by-google--nd801) program.

## API KEY

The application makes use of [The Movie DB](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API.  Given it is bad practice to upload API keys to public repositories, it is not included here.

As such, you will need to request your own personal API Key. Once you have obtained your key, simply do the following:

 - Add a gradle.properties file to the root of the project
 - Add the following line to the new file and replace "your_key_goes_here" with your valid key
 
** **
    TheMovieDatabaseApiKey="your_key_goes_here"
** **

note:  the method to 'hide the API key' was patterned after this [article](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/android/web-service-backends-and-custom-fragments/managing-api-keys).
